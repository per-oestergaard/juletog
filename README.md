Controlling my christmas tree

## Current state

- Speed good
- Good sounds
- Sounds when running at different times
- Random sounds when idle
- Runs again after a while (sets start state)
- Monitors HAT (there is a bug so sometimes it detects this and the audio says reboot, but does not)
- Monitors black and logs using \a, but that is into the logs
- Warns of when it needs recharging

## Ideas

- Log to data file in CSV/line-JSON format
- Stops based on colored bricks at station (near charger, maybe postpone charger audio). Maybe plates without studs are easier to detect?
- Sound at certain times (before crossing)
- Dog bark while driving by dog?
- Fart brick?
